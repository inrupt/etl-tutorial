# Ignore folder used to install vocabs from remote repositories (for when we
# wish to work a lot with terms in those vocabs). Having those vocabs locally
# means we can use the Artifact Generator to 'watch' them, and therefore
# automatically re-generate the corresponding source-code when we make edits
# to the local vocab copies (meaning developers can use new or changed terms
# immediately in their main code).
# (Of course, we need to remember to create PRs to the upstream repository
# when we're done!). We can also store here locally generated artifacts from
# local vocabs that we don't yet want to publish anywhere public yet.

# Ignore any generated script files that allow quick re-watching of bundles of
# vocabs.

# If we run the Artifact Generator locally, then by default it will generate
# to this directory, so ignore it, just as a precaution.
Generated

# Ignore all local resources, such as real user credential files, or local
# copies of real user API responses that we may wish to use during development
# (as opposed to making repeated actual API calls during development as we
# experiment with modelling). Since these files contain sensitive information,
# we must make sure they don't get pushed to source control.
