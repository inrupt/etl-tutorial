# Visualizing Pod data

These simple instructions walk you through the 10-minute process of registering
for the Free edition of the commercial triplestore from Ontotext (named
_GraphDB_), installing that triplestore, creating a new repository, loading some
dummy Pod data into that repository, and finally visualizing that Pod data
yourself.

## Install Free triplestore on your own machine:

- Go to `https://www.ontotext.com/products/graphdb/graphdb-free/` and register.
  (Within a few minutes you should receive a confirmation email with a link to
  download and install the triplestore (make sure to keep an eye on your Trash
  or Spam folder!)).

- In the confirmation email, select the option to "_Run GraphDB as a desktop
  installation_" for your operating system.

## Run GraphDB

- Execute GraphDB.

## Create a new repository

We'll now simply follow the introductory "_Welcome to GraphDB_" steps, which
we'll also walk through below:

To create a new empty repository:

- From the main menu (on the left-hand-side), select "Setup | Repositories".
- Click the "_Create new repository_" button.
- Select the "_GraphDB Free_" option.
- Provide any name (without spaces!) for the "_Repository ID_" field, e.g.,
  "inrupt-example".
- Click the "_Create_" button at the bottom of the page.

## Load example Pod data:

- From the main menu (on the left-hand-side), select "_Import | RDF_".
- Connect to the repository youâ€™ve just created.
- Select "_Get RDF data from a URL_".
- Cut-and-paste the URL of our example data file:
  `https://pod.inrupt.com/pattestburner1/public/PodPat.trig`
- Click on the "_Import_" button to the right of the filename.
- Just click the "_Import_" button (i.e., there's no need to enter or change
  anything).

## Visualize and interact with the Pod data yourself!

- From the main menu (on the left-hand-side), select "_Explore | Visual graph_".
- In the top "_Easy graph_" section, simply copy-and-paste this URL:
  `https://pat.best-pod-provider.com/profile/card#me`
- ...and click the "_Show_" button
- Now try double-clicking on the nodes to expand them and explore (see a sample
  expanded view [here](./VisualizeExamplePodData.png)).
