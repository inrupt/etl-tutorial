# Real Data directory

The intention of this directory is to hold local copies of real data, such as real responses from
data source APIs from real user accounts that we can use during the development process (so that we
don't make repeated API calls, or so that we can run our ETL process fully offline).

The contents of this directory MUST not be committed to source control, as they necessarily may
contain sensitive user data.
